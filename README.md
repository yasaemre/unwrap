# unwrap
Unwrap logo    Twitter: @twostraws  Unwrap is an app that helps you learn Swift faster and more effectively.  At its core lies almost 100 video lessons that teach all the fundamentals of the Swift programming language, with each lesson backed up by an interactive review.  Once you’ve made some progress learning, you can dive into a selection of practice activities that make you write code by tapping, dragging, or typing, find errors, predict program output, and more. There are also daily challenges that test your overall language knowledge once per day, helping your new skills really sink in.  At some point hopefully soon Unwrap will be available to download for free on the App Store. Until then, I’ve made the code available so that anyone who wants to can see how I structure my code and perhaps learn from it. If you’d like to help you’re most welcome to and there are many opportunities, but make sure you read the contribution guidelines first.
